 MV: Anatomy of Anatomy (2014)  PL: When legendary Hollywood director Otto Preminger chose Michigan's rustic PL: Upper Peninsula as the filming location for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), he PL: not only changed the way movies would get made for decades to come, he PL: forever altered a Midwestern community. Anatomy of 'Anatomy' tells the PL: story of how Marquette became the backdrop for an Oscar-nominated motion PL: picture and how the lives of the locals it touched were never the same PL: again.  BY: Anonymous  PL: In 1959, larger-than-life director Otto Preminger made his way to a small PL: town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to direct a movie that was based on the PL: writings of small-town fisherman and attorney John D. Voelker, who went by PL: the pen name John Traver. The movie carried the same title as Voelker's PL: best selling novel, Anatomy of a Murder. The film went on to receive seven PL: Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. It has been described as PL: one of the finest pure trial films ever made. Just as courtroom dramas PL: would never be the same, neither would the hamlet of Ishpeming. The PL: documentary Anatomy of 'Anatomy' brings to life the memoir of Joan Hansen, PL: who was an inn hostess at the time Anatomy of a Murder was being made. PL: Hansen was a friend and neighbor of the Voelker family and befriended many PL: of the actors who took up residence at the Mather Inn during the filming. PL: In fact, she formed a special bond with Duke Ellington, who in turn wrote a PL: song for the movie based on Hansen's walk. He named the song Flirtbird. PL: Hansen's writings not only detailed her personal knowledge of the author PL: and her relationship with the actors, they relayed the impact this film had PL: on the small Michigan town. The movie's influence is still noticeable PL: today. In the documentary, Hansen's words are woven with a combination of PL: old photographs and recollections from those who took part in the magical PL: film making of this courtroom classic. Topics addressed in the film include PL: Otto Preminger's infamous temper, Ben Gazzara's flirty nature, Jimmy PL: Stewart's charm and ease, Duke Ellington's generosity, George C. Scott's PL: fondness for a drink, Eve Arden's tender nature and how leading actress and PL: new mother Lee Remick juggled her professional and maternal roles. The PL: groundbreaking film itself is also explored. The story, based on a real PL: courtroom case, provides a clear window into what happens in the courtroom PL: and continues to serve as the courtroom drama that all others are measured PL: by. The dialog of the famous drama also altered the industry. Never before PL: had film goers been exposed to sex and rape in such graphics terms. What's PL: more, Anatomy of a Murder made its mark on Hollywood by going outside of PL: Hollywood. Shooting a film entirely on location was certainly not the norm PL: in those days. Indeed, Anatomy of a Murder has made a lasting impact on the PL: movie industry and the locals of Ishpeming. Now, the documentary Anatomy of PL: 'Anatomy' enables everyone to go inside the making of the movie from the PL: perspective of those who lived it.  BY: Claire Wiley

 MV: The Spoiler (2014)  PL: Amid the walls of an opulent mansion the adult children of the fractious PL: and dysfunctional Darmoody family gather to the bedside of their frail and PL: sickly father for what may be his final months. Jesse Darmoody, the PL: youngest and most morally conscious and emotionally clean, of the family is PL: bordering on the bliss of life's new journey as he escapes his family home PL: and heads to university. The forlorn state that seeps into him upon hearing PL: the news of his father's latest heart attack seems as much about the PL: thought of returning to the home and family he has just escaped as it is PL: about his father's failing health. Jesse's older siblings, their dim but PL: decorative partners, trophy wives and the rest of the extended family are PL: an ungodly bunch of apples, all in one way or another rotten at their core; PL: A select group of deeply charmless individuals and slippery bastards either PL: permanently unemployed and in desperate need of cash, beset by drinking PL: problems and drug addictions, as well as a severe array of ubiquitous PL: 'daddy' issues. They sit morosely scowling round the sick bed like a bunch PL: of vultures seemingly waiting for the old man to die. Only Jesse's return PL: brings light and a breath of life back to his father. It being no real PL: secret that he's his father's favourite child, as well as the fact that PL: Tobias Darmoody, is a staunch believer that his snivelling morally defunct PL: set of offspring should make their own way in the world without use of any PL: of his riches, Jesse is only mildly surprised when his older brother PL: Freddie breaks the news that the family inheritance leaves him enough to PL: afford a college education and the remainder of his relatives nothing but PL: scratchings from the family pot. Clearly accustomed to having been kicked PL: around by his elder relatives all his life, Jesse is less than shocked when PL: they break to him the news of a plot they've hatched in a last ditch PL: attempt to get their hands on their father's millions before he croaks. PL: However even Jesse couldn't have imagined that his siblings would have PL: dreamed up a con involving them staging his faked kidnapping and extorting PL: a six figured ransom for his safe return. A ransom to then be shared among PL: them equally and fund their high spending slacker life-styles. Initially PL: outraged by what he is being coerced into Jesse rejects the idea. However PL: the one chink in his armour, Ruri Lim, the alluring, bewitching, PL: half-hellion daughter of the Darmoody's long term hired help applies some PL: fairly relentless arm twisting and sultry manipulation and soon Jesse finds PL: himself succumbing to their scheme and his own personal collision course PL: with fate. Without any relevant criminal experience Jesse questions how his PL: scheming siblings would carry out their grotty little plot, his questions PL: answered with the sickening realisation that Ruri's fianc�, Cody Bunting, PL: will be the man orchestrating the nefarious proceedings. With this news PL: Jesse's part in his family's conspiracy begins an immediate descent on a PL: downward spiral into an abyss of unshakable dread for he knows only too PL: well that Ruri's, coldly smiling boyfriend is nothing short of a cold PL: blooded sociopath; bleak, cruel, brutal and monstrous, and his agreement to PL: his own abduction feels more like his consent to his own murder. The PL: all-pervading sense of doom hangs heavy in the air for Jesse within the PL: dark rooms and quiet corners of the Darmoody mansion as he awaits his fate. PL: And when Jesse's appointment with fate does arrive, things soon go PL: horribly, homicidally wrong, for the frail and sickly paterfamilias, PL: awakened by the three masked intruders in his home, gathers his strength PL: and makes one tragic attempt to protect his youngest child. With Tobias's PL: weak effort to rescue his son resulting in his own 'slightly sooner than PL: expected' death, and Jesse holed away in a dreadful lonely place without PL: food or water and a ransom that can now never be paid, the Darmoody PL: children are left to realise that their failings, greed and flawed twisted PL: plan have betrayed their brother, potentially sealed his fate and come back PL: to haunt them in the worst possible way. As Jesse hangs between life and PL: death, each colossally bad decision by the Darmoody family lead to another, PL: already weak relationships are tested and loyalties start to drastically PL: shift. Caught in the pitiless trap, Jesse has no option but to go to PL: inhuman lengths to come to his own salvation. However his attempts are PL: shrouded by a miasma of evil in the form of Cody Bunting who, with masterly PL: cunning, endeavours to ensure that the 'perfect plan' still goes his way. PL: But just as fate can turn one way, it can also turn another, and the final PL: twist pits the mercilessly brutal against the gently intelligent and fate PL: proves to be more than ironic, one last time.

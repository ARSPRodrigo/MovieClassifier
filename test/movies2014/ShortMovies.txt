 MV: 3 Long Takes Dedicated to Abbas Kiarostami (2014) (V)  PL: Abbas Kiarostami's 'Five dedicated to Ozu' experiments with the illusion of PL: director's detachment to cinema - a unique approach which utilizes the PL: static camera, the long take, passive recording and active interpretation. PL: It is the form which is seen during the birth of cinema - the strategy PL: adapted by Lumiere brothers. Later on the use of long take was pioneered by PL: several master directors especially Yasujir� Ozu, Andrei Tarkovsky and PL: among the modern greats primarily Theodoros Angelopoulos. Kiarostami's PL: 'Five' reaches the pinnacle of the experiments till date. '3 long takes PL: dedicated to Abbas Kiarostami' does not try to emulate 'Five' but tries to PL: show the stages in cinema which led to 'Five'. Hence the segments show the PL: transitions in camera movement from active to the illusion of PL: static.However, as is the essence of Kiarostami's most films, the dualism PL: between'passive recording' and 'active interpretation' is the central theme PL: of this film too. Segment 1: the camera is actively involved but shows PL: glimpses of passive recording. Segment 2: the camera follows the object as PL: if attached to it. Segment 3: the camera is actually moving along a track PL: but generates the illusion of static recording.  BY: Dyutiman Mukhopadhyay

 MV: Acadian Nights (2014)  PL: Marked by vibrant color, hypnotic interludes, and sensual appeal, Acadian PL: Nights is an experiential art film inspired by the universality of dreams- PL: particularly dreams of houses and the spaces that contain us.

Archetypes of family emerge from seemingly abstract images PL: into a narrative grounded in the cycle of waking and dreaming.

Lance Grayden, a PL: veteran coach who left the league years ago when his daughter moved to an PL: elite softball club team, and then college, has returned to "give something PL: back" to the community. He assumed he'd be coaching a 16-and-under team of PL: seasoned and accomplished competitors, but instead is saddled with a PL: 10-and-under team of inexperienced players. Not only is he forced to go PL: back to the basics and teach the fundamentals of the game to the little PL: girls, half of whom would rather be in the dugout eating snacks, but he PL: also faces the greater challenge of riding herd over their over-eager, PL: overly ambitious, and entirely delusional parents whose ridiculous behavior PL: is more suited to five-year-olds than adults. Lance also faces a personal PL: decision about whether it's more important to win at all costs or to teach PL: the girls something their parents seem to have forgotten: that each player PL: is a valuable member of the team and fair play is more important than PL: winning. Even though he knows what the answer should be, Lance's moral PL: compass is severely tested by the relentless take-no-prisoners mentality of PL: the parents as well as his own ambitions and innate drive to win. He may be PL: dealing with eight, nine, and ten-year-old little girls, but he is, after PL: all, only human. Meanwhile, each parent is on a mission to ensure that PL: their nine-year-old prodigy is recognized as the elite athlete they imagine PL: her to be, whether or not she possesses one whit of actual athletic PL: ability. The parents' blind ambitions, combined with their grand delusions, PL: give each parent the baseless notion that the Holy Grail - an All-Star PL: jacket with their child's name on the back - is not only within reach, but PL: is her God-given-birthright. "All-Stars" provides a hilarious commentary on PL: the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of PL: the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In PL: the vein of a Christopher Guest film - think "Best in Show" where it's more PL: about the dog owners than the dogs - "All-Stars" is about the adults PL: involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board PL: members, etc.) more than the kids.

 MV: Anatomy of Anatomy (2014)  PL: When legendary Hollywood director Otto Preminger chose Michigan's rustic PL: Upper Peninsula as the filming location for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), he PL: not only changed the way movies would get made for decades to come, he PL: forever altered a Midwestern community. Anatomy of 'Anatomy' tells the PL: story of how Marquette became the backdrop for an Oscar-nominated motion PL: picture and how the lives of the locals it touched were never the same PL: again.  BY: Anonymous  PL: In 1959, larger-than-life director Otto Preminger made his way to a small PL: town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula to direct a movie that was based on the PL: writings of small-town fisherman and attorney John D. Voelker, who went by PL: the pen name John Traver. The movie carried the same title as Voelker's PL: best selling novel, Anatomy of a Murder. The film went on to receive seven PL: Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. It has been described as PL: one of the finest pure trial films ever made. Just as courtroom dramas PL: would never be the same, neither would the hamlet of Ishpeming. The PL: documentary Anatomy of 'Anatomy' brings to life the memoir of Joan Hansen, PL: who was an inn hostess at the time Anatomy of a Murder was being made. PL: Hansen was a friend and neighbor of the Voelker family and befriended many PL: of the actors who took up residence at the Mather Inn during the filming. PL: In fact, she formed a special bond with Duke Ellington, who in turn wrote a PL: song for the movie based on Hansen's walk. He named the song Flirtbird. PL: Hansen's writings not only detailed her personal knowledge of the author PL: and her relationship with the actors, they relayed the impact this film had PL: on the small Michigan town. The movie's influence is still noticeable PL: today. In the documentary, Hansen's words are woven with a combination of PL: old photographs and recollections from those who took part in the magical PL: film making of this courtroom classic. Topics addressed in the film include PL: Otto Preminger's infamous temper, Ben Gazzara's flirty nature, Jimmy PL: Stewart's charm and ease, Duke Ellington's generosity, George C. Scott's PL: fondness for a drink, Eve Arden's tender nature and how leading actress and PL: new mother Lee Remick juggled her professional and maternal roles. The PL: groundbreaking film itself is also explored. The story, based on a real PL: courtroom case, provides a clear window into what happens in the courtroom PL: and continues to serve as the courtroom drama that all others are measured PL: by. The dialog of the famous drama also altered the industry. Never before PL: had film goers been exposed to sex and rape in such graphics terms. What's PL: more, Anatomy of a Murder made its mark on Hollywood by going outside of PL: Hollywood. Shooting a film entirely on location was certainly not the norm PL: in those days. Indeed, Anatomy of a Murder has made a lasting impact on the PL: movie industry and the locals of Ishpeming. Now, the documentary Anatomy of PL: 'Anatomy' enables everyone to go inside the making of the movie from the PL: perspective of those who lived it.  BY: Claire Wiley

 MV: Bleaching Black Culture (2014)  PL: From the birth of jazz to the evolution of hip hop; the advents of urban PL: trends to transformative advances in technology, African Americans have PL: played an integral role in molding American culture. Unfortunately, we tend PL: to not be the beneficiaries of our own innovation. Bleaching Black Culture PL: examines the continuum of America's black cultural appropriation and PL: effects on the African American community. The imprint of cultural theft PL: has a long legacy, and this power of influence in music, sports, fashion PL: and art translates into millions of dollars for our country. So, if the PL: AfricanAmerican community is the cultural architect, why are we still PL: outside of the building begging to get in? Cultural branding has not only PL: helped to exploit the hip hop community along with other forms of black PL: art, but it's managed to monetize off of black marginalization. Currently, PL: the Rhythm and Blues billboard chart, a genre developed for the African PL: American voice, is dominated with the likes of Robin Thicke, Justin Bieber, PL: and Adele. Perhaps, it's easier to sell black art when it's masked in PL: "white face." Yet the argument with the latter comes from the 2013 African PL: American consumer report. It shows black buying power rising from its PL: current astonishing $1 trillion level to a fore casted $1.3 trillion by PL: 2017. Since the African American community is the number one consumer, it PL: begs to ask - can we take ownership of our cultural influence and convert PL: our buying power into economic capital? Or, with the appropriation of black PL: culture becoming more and more exploitive and lucrative, is admiration the PL: new bastardization?  BY: Anonymous

 MV: Camaraderie (2014)  PL: A lonely old man, a World War II veteran taken ill with Alzheimer's PL: disease, and the Nurse, Mia, tending to him in Hospital. This becomes the PL: dominant setting off the film, and the only place the Old Man will ever PL: come to visit again. We see his life between the unblemished walls has PL: simmered down to nothing more than a memory, his transition to the Hospital PL: is uneasy, his incurable disease adding to the confusion and fear in his PL: sterile new environment. It is presumably only the care of Mia the only PL: comfort he receives that keeps him alive through these time bending, PL: reflective end times. Half of the film revolves around the nameless Old PL: Man, whose past is revealed to have more trauma than just the War. He had a PL: Wife, a Son, but now they seem to have disappeared, leaving him to face his PL: final days alone. Their whereabouts unknown, until the film begins to PL: unfold. One thing perhaps that is missed from the War, the comradely. Mia PL: is no stranger to trauma herself, and it is her story that kick starts the PL: film. She is only young, never specified, but around 20years, a little over PL: perhaps. A glimpse into childhood shows her life has already been littered PL: with problems, including an abusive Father figure and a teenage experience PL: with self harm. One cannot fault Mia for accepting her experiences and PL: becoming a Nurse, with the honest aim to aid. She has succeeded in the face PL: of adversity, however, her past has certainly stayed with her, showed PL: evidently in her daily Cocaine sniffing routine in the Staff Washroom on PL: the Ward. She is in terrible debt. It is suggested she is a Mother, and PL: therefore a single Mother, being that she's only seen alone. For Mia, life PL: is hard. She finds a certain solace in the Old Man, maybe it's a case of PL: silently sharing in each others pain, while simultaneously being ignorant PL: of each others true situation. This predicament is at the heart of their PL: relationship.  BY: Matthew Harrison  PL: Old World War II Veteran in Hospital with Alzheimer's disease, and the PL: struggling, debt-riddled Nurse caring for him, Mia.

 MV: Camp X (2014) (TV)  PL: During the Second World War, with Hitler's forces dominating Western PL: Europe, the Allies knew that conventional warfare alone would not be enough PL: for victory over the brutal Nazi regime. What they needed were secret PL: agents, who could be dropped into enemy territory to gather intelligence, PL: organize the resistance, and cause chaos through any means possible. But PL: while Britain was not well versed in clandestine warfare, the USA nor PL: Canada had any experience whatsoever of sending spies behind enemy lines. PL: In espionage terms, Britain stood alone. So a joint plan was forged between PL: Britain and America to train an army of spies in the dark arts of sabotage, PL: subversion, and guerilla warfare. To help keep the new Anglo-American PL: alliance a secret, the decision was made to set up the elite school in PL: Canada, close to Toronto. Overseen by British experts and instructors, it PL: was known officially as Special Training School 103. But to those who PL: trained there it went by another name - CAMP X. Opening within days of the PL: Pearl Harbor bombing, Camp X was the first spy school in North America. It PL: became the model on which America's espionage training was based, all of PL: which was laid down in a top-secret manual written specifically for the PL: Camp. A one-of-a-kind document, it taught new recruits everything they PL: needed to know about how to be a spy. Following training, North American PL: spies were sent around the world to take on enemies from Germany and Japan PL: in a deadly chess game of move and counter move that lasted the entire war. PL: Told through the incredible stories of these real-life James Bonds, this PL: film traces the evolution of espionage in North America, and explains how PL: the men and women who were the world's first modern spies were vital in PL: helping the Allies to victory... Starting at the opening of Camp X, it uses PL: first hand accounts from WW2 spies to explore all the key skills required PL: to conduct WW2 espionage, including demolitions, codes and ciphers, cover PL: stories and close combat, all of which are intimately detailed in the Camp PL: X training manual. It then ends with the dramatic key role that Camp X PL: played in helping to reveal the threat posed by the Soviets in the earliest PL: days of the Cold War, and the revelation that one of the writers of the PL: manual was secretly a Soviet mole, who would later become one of the most PL: infamous defectors in history - Kim Philby. Through this process of PL: discovery, Camp X reveals how the work that began at this WW2 spy school PL: laid the foundations for the world most famous intelligence agency... the PL: CIA.

 MV: Chafariz das Virtudes (2014)  PL: Every year the Viennale invites a famous director to produce a short film PL: as the festival trailer. In 2014 the choice has fallen on the 105-year old PL: Manoel de Oliveira. This year's trailer of the Viennale, the 21st since PL: 1995, was made by the Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira. Oliveira is PL: at the age of 105 years not only the probably oldest filmmaker who is still PL: active, but also one of the big masters in the history of cinema. His first PL: film DOURO, FAINA FLUVIAL originated in 1931 - his last up to now, the PL: short O VELHO DO RESTELO was shot this summer. 83 years are between those PL: two movies... The trailer of the Viennale derives from the invitation of PL: the festival to the filmmaker. It has originated in the connection and PL: during the work on his new 20-minute film O VELHO TH RESTELO which had his PL: world premiere a few weeks ago at the film festival of Venice. In this PL: film, a series of free associative fantasies about literature, history and PL: the figure of the Don Quijote, a water-spouting fountain is to be seen for PL: some moments, a setting which resolves in a cross-fade to sea waves, PL: whilethe voice of the narrator is to be heard. For his trailer, Oliveira PL: has chosen the same setting. It shows a baroque wall fountain in the PL: Portuguese town of Porto, which is called "Chafariz das Virtudes" i.e. "The PL: fountain of virtues". Porto is the very town in the north of Portugal in PL: which Manoel de Oliveira was born and has been growing up and which is PL: still today a central reference point of the artist. The fountain, which PL: was dried-out for many years, was brought back to life again especially for PL: this film. Unlike in O VELHO DO RESTELO the fountain in the Viennale PL: Trailer stands completely for itself: For the duration of one minute and a PL: single shot, accompanied only by the noise of the flowing water. "It is", PL: Viennale director Hans Hurch says, "a pure picture of the passing time, the PL: trickling away of life, of the present and the irretrievably lost at the PL: same time. And it is maybe the most simple and mysterious of all Viennale PL: trailers for me. While watching this strange cinematic haiku, I have to PL: think over and over again about this long, rich life of that old man from PL: Porto who has given us this film."  BY: Viennale  
 MV: Challenging Heaven (2014)  PL: In August 1945, at the tail end of WW2, a young GI, a Chinese language PL: expert, is flown over the roof of the world into China. His name is Sidney PL: Rittenberg. Rittenberg is an idealist. On his discharge from the army, he PL: decides to stay on. It's the start of a strange and dangerous adventure. He PL: makes contact with some young Chinese - idealists like himself -- who are PL: working for the revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong and against the military PL: dictatorship of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek. One of these young PL: revolutionaries is a beautiful girl called Yulin. As Civil War looms, PL: Rittenberg gets more and more deeply committed. American foreign policy is PL: ostensibly to broker a peace between Mao and Chiang. In reality, America is PL: backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the PL: Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, PL: towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret PL: overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But PL: nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall PL: and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a PL: disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in PL: Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with PL: Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and PL: Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. PL: America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the PL: Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is PL: ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel PL: deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no PL: choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from PL: Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for PL: himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged PL: his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. PL: On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He PL: stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney PL: Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the PL: revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the PL: first time, from a completely fresh perspective.

The goal is to provide new hope PL: and a chance to a changing Armenia. TUMO provides these young adults the PL: same opportunities as those afforded to those in the Western world. Many PL: TUMO students expressed that if the Center did not exist, they would not be PL: able to have this opportunity. The film questions the importance of any PL: nations Diaspora's involvement in the growth and change of a developing PL: country. While it is a creative school, one thing for sure that everyone PL: agrees on, it is more than that. It provides hope in creativity and ignites PL: the spark that is needed. It is a start. All this is made possible by an PL: American whose own innovative nature and Western mentality gave birth to a PL: vision that feeds the need of a small nation.  BY: Zealpix

PL: Four years later, the communist nation characterized by some as having PL: "practically stone age technology" sent the first man into space. It was PL: the Space Race, and America was behind. When President John F. Kennedy PL: boldly declared America would land a man on the moon by the end of the PL: 1960s, shockingly little was known about Earth's companion. How old was it? PL: What caused the craters? Was the surface solid enough to support a PL: spacecraft full of astronauts? Long before the Space Race began, Dr. Gerard PL: Kuiper was already looking for answers. At the University of Chicago's PL: Yerkes Observatory, he published a groundbreaking photographic lunar atlas. PL: Now his eye was on the Southwest. At the University of Arizona, he PL: established the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, one of the first planetary PL: science research institutions in the world. Kuiper's team published three PL: more lunar atlases that were used by NASA to search for places where PL: astronauts could land. He also became the principal experimenter for the PL: Ranger program, an effort to crash-land a spacecraft equipped with PL: television cameras into the moon. Meanwhile, a University of Arizona PL: geologist taught Kuiper's students a new way to look at the moon. A PL: UA-trained physicist risked his career for the ultimate photo op-commanding PL: a spacecraft in lunar orbit to snap a picture of the Earth. Another Lunar PL: and Planetary Laboratory scientist pinpointed the landing spot of a robotic PL: spacecraft on the lunar surface, setting up a future visit from Apollo 12 PL: astronauts. The path to winning the Space Race was paved under the light of PL: a desert moon.  BY: Jason Davis  PL: In 1961, President John F. Kennedy declared Americans would walk on the PL: moon by the end of the decade. Many documentaries have highlighted the PL: engineering effort that led to Neil Armstrong's 'one small step,' but few PL: have looked at the role science played. Was the moon's surface solid, or PL: just dust? Scientists couldn't say for sure, as they scrambled to map the PL: moon, send probes to its surface, and select astronaut landing sites. At PL: the University of Arizona, astronomer Gerard Kuiper led the way. Desert PL: Moon features interviews with Kuiper's fellow scientists, along with PL: restored archival footage and photographs. Using the lens of the space PL: race, Desert Moon examines the fascinating chain of events that led to the PL: creation of planetary science.  BY: Anonymous

 MV: Dolly Deadly (2014)  PL: Dolly Deadly is a feature film of the psychological horror/revenge genre PL: written by Heidi Moore and Cassandra Sechler. Heidi Moore, the director of PL: Dolly Deadly, is a Chico based filmmaker who is well known for her short PL: "Boyfriend" and work for Wretched productions. She came across the work of PL: Cassandra Sechler, director of "Wireboy" and leader of Dreams For Dead Cats PL: productions, and thought it would be fun to combine forces for a feature PL: film. Though both have a distinct style, Heidi and Cassandra both love 70's PL: and 80's horror films, trash & cult cinema, low budget filmmaking, and PL: practical fx, so it comes as no surprise that a collaborative effort is in PL: the works for them. Dolly Deadly is sure to be a little creepy, a bit PL: silly, and a lot of fun (think Troma meets John Waters). The story of Dolly PL: Deadly revolves around the warped psychology of a tormented young boy who PL: can only relate to his doll collection, and the only relief from the pain PL: in his life comes with slaughtering those he has learned to hate the most. PL: Everyone in his trailer park! The film is to be a whirlwind of vengeful PL: deaths, elaborate dream sequences, and crazy characters. In the production, PL: there will not be any cgi, so all effects will involve handmade prosthetics PL: and blood for all of the head wounds, chainsaw deaths, jaw cracking action, PL: skinned faces, spurting blood, stab wounds, rotting corpse makeup, fire PL: stunts, and explosions! For one dream sequence claymation and puppetry will PL: be used! That's right, old school effects!  BY: Cassandra Sechler

 MV: Domino (2014/III)  PL: Train is an enigmatic short experimental film exploring mimicry and methods PL: of communication through ritualistic deadpan absurdity. The film depicts an PL: artist embodying different systems of activity when a train passes through PL: a station.

The artist acts out the PL: eponymous train, but underneath the surface layer of imitation lies an PL: element of derision. Derisive of whom, is the question. Is the artist PL: mocking the audience's tolerance for contemporary art by spending three PL: minutes repetitively acting out a simple idea? Or is the artist parodying PL: himself by reducing the sacred artistic concept to a superficial game of PL: charades?

PL: It is written and directed by 16 year old film maker Ben Medina, shot by 17 PL: year old film maker Maria Elias, and stars 18 year old Dominican actress PL: Maria Nunez.

PL: From the time they were small children they have always looked out for each PL: other and now they are in their early 20s little has changed.

However when Sam drags PL: Daniel into a particularly life- altering situation, the brothers have to PL: make a decision, whether they hand themselves in to the police or run away. PL: The brothers conflicting views on what to do leads to decisions about PL: whether they can stick together through this, like they always have, or if PL: they'll finally have to go their separate ways. The issue is complicated PL: further when Sam's increasingly selfish nature starts to come out, making PL: Daniel question whether Sam really is doing what he thinks is best for them PL: both and if he is willing to continue to blindly follow his brother in and PL: out of various situations or if he should start to stand up for himself and PL: make his own choices. These decisions force them to seek advice from PL: someone from their past, their estranged father, someone that they'd rather PL: leave behind. This is a difficult visit for the brothers and they hope PL: their father will be able to point them in the right direction but his PL: personal agenda and shady activities get in the way once again leaving Sam PL: and Daniel with no clearer answers than they had before and all the more PL: desperate to make their final decisions.

When PL: he is brought along on an execution, and is handed the weapon and ordered PL: to pull the trigger on the unfortunate victim, he suddenly realises that PL: everything he thought he valued, and everything he ever believed he stood PL: for, is instantly challenged in that moment. But with his peers watching PL: on, and willing him to complete his 'assignment', James knows that the PL: choice he makes in those last precious few seconds will stay with him for a PL: lifetime. He will come to discover that when you take another man's life, PL: it's in the end of one, that another is so terribly changed. What James PL: ultimately discovers about himself will inevitably and fatally have a PL: profound effect on him, and will firmly test the real reasons and PL: motivations behind his apparent desire to be part of a 'family' that once PL: inside, he will never be able to leave behind.

 MV: Introspection (2014)  PL: A silent protagonist explores the Entheogen Dimethyltryptamine in this PL: animated, allegoric depiction of the mechanisms society has to damage and PL: abstract the self.  BY: Anonymous  PL: Introspection depicts the abstract space of consciousness, which all PL: individuals explore. In this case, to improve the translation of this space PL: into the visual medium, self-exploration is propagated through the PL: entheogen, Dimethyltryptamine. The way that society operates puts many PL: barriers between the individual and an understanding of themselves, and the PL: narrative of Introspection serves as an allegory to this. Expectations from PL: the recreational context the drug is ingested in, mean that little of the PL: entheogenic, transcendental quality of the experience is found to be PL: salient. The sets communicate the contrast between the material existence PL: and introspective spaces. Once the protagonist begins hallucinating, the PL: set design and narrative become a dynamic of his affective state. PL: Neurocognitive film theory paradigms (e.g. PECMA flow, meta-emotive theory) PL: are employed to elicit congruent affective states in the audience, with PL: divisive use of simple shapes, symmetry and incoherent spaces being PL: exemplary of this.

Combined they are more than 2700 years old: the PL: youngest is barely twenty and the oldest celebrated her 70th birthday years PL: ago. This is where the postwar generation meets postmodernity; the PL: minister's daughter from the once-socialist East meets the Catholic girl PL: from Cologne; the organic farmer meets the food chemist; and the PL: policewoman, the bohemian. Some love women; others, men. They live with PL: children or without, as a couple or confirmed single. They wear PL: Birkenstocks, high heels, or walk barefoot. All kinds of women are welcome PL: in this open-minded, tolerant community. No matter where a woman comes PL: from, how she votes, or whom she loves. There's only one requirement: a PL: love of music. Once you have attended an FBOB concert, you too will realize PL: that these women are not your run-of-the-mill band of lay musicians. PL: Instead, their joy in playing and in living is contagious-no matter whether PL: they are performing in Berlin's Philharmonic Hall, the Zeiss planetarium, PL: or a beer tent in Bavaria. At a time of growing social isolation, the FBOB PL: is a piece of real solidarity; a place where perfectly ordinary (yet PL: different) women pull together to pull off something PL: extraordinary-precisely because they always remain true to themselves.

 MV: L'esposizione del lenzuolo (2014)  PL: The project is inspired by an ancient tradition linked to marriage, which PL: still lives on in the collective memory of the South of Italy although no PL: longer practiced. The tradition was to display the blood-stained bed sheet PL: from the window after the wedding night in order to demonstrate the woman's PL: virginity. The story of the bed sheet is not a real story, but rather a PL: tale only a few sentences long, which never did really explain anything, PL: but generated somewhat unsettling images about the wedding night and the PL: end of virginity. This lack of stories surrounding the custom led us on one PL: hand to go and meet the oldest women to gather their testimonies and, on PL: the other, to invite them to take part in a liberating and iconoclastic PL: gesture to be undertaken all together in the square. In the main town PL: square, for this is the public space par excellence, where traditionally, PL: women have always been given precious little visibility. Instead in this PL: case, the women actually become performing artists for a brief time. Just PL: to have fun, like those American artists who consecrated gesturing in PL: contemporary art while these women were out breaking their backs in the PL: countryside, or to transcend, like Oriental masters capable in a single PL: move of shifting... a few kilos of tradition.

On this journey, David, whose family is of Jewish PL: descent, shockingly discovers that many on the island believe "Man of the PL: Monkey" is an escaped Nazi. He also comes to find out that the island, PL: which was a refuge for the filmmaker's father after fleeing political PL: persecution in Argentina during the 1970s, was paradoxically home to a PL: prison for Brazilian political dissidents during that same time period. In PL: this personal documentary, strange parallels emerge between the people, PL: places, and stories of Ilha Grande. David's unique journey retraces the PL: tracks that brought his father and "Man of the Monkey" to the same remote PL: island in search of sanctuary. The film confronts David's childhood PL: fantasies with complex realities that are more fascinating than PL: frightening, and contrasts the power of myth with the intricacies of PL: reality.

 MV: Never Too Big (2014)  PL: Daniel was Norway's greatest bodybuilding talent until he got overly cocky PL: on a photo shoot.

Meanwhile his junior day nemesis Steven Lang PL: is reigning champion and set to win Arnold Schwarzenegger's new tournament PL: Never Too Big. The Idol-inspired 24/7 reality-TV concept is meant to be a PL: game changer that will bring bodybuilding to huge mainstream audiences. PL: Back at his father's gym in Oslo, Daniel sits down with an old PL: acquaintance. A vial is slid across the table. An offer is made. In it is PL: the holy grail of pharmaceuticals, the product of a race that started in PL: 1997 when scientists discovered the gene that controls myostatin. It's a PL: protein that tells your body to stop when it's grown sufficient muscle PL: size. If you turn it off, you get Belgian Blue cows. You get mice that PL: double their lean muscle mass in weeks. This new drug works great to put a PL: few kilos on aging dystrophy patients, but is yet to be tested on excessive PL: weightlifters or young men. Its promise is that a few shots is all it takes PL: for anyone to grow lean and muscular. The potential black market is worth PL: billions. All they need is the right poster boy to prove their point. And PL: to find out what the possible side effects of unrestrained abuse could be. PL: Daniel is given a second chance to live the dream he has sacrificed so much PL: for. The fame, the money, the women, and the championship - all he has to PL: risk are his health and his life. In New Orleans waits a showdown Daniel PL: has dreamt of and prepared for his entire life. For men like him, muscles PL: and dreams are Never Too Big.  BY: Mads Larsen  PL: Daniel "The Perfect Viking" was the greatest bodybuilding talent in PL: Norwegian history.

His last PL: chance of fame is to win the fan-voted Wildcard to compete in Arnold PL: Schwarzenegger's new bodybuilding game changer. Never Too Big is a PL: four-week 24/7 online bodybuilding bonanza to culminate in a globally PL: televised weekend show off to crown the ultimate champion. Meanwhile, PL: PharmaCorp has just won the two-decade-long race to submit Myostatin PL: Inhibitors for FDA approval. It doubles lean muscle mass in lab mice. PL: Dystrophy patients bulk up without working out. The wonder drug with PL: unknown side effects for abusers, stands to forever change the way not only PL: bodybuilders, but humanity looks.

With Helen sliding into dementia, Sophia must confront her PL: own demons. Did she ever truly know this woman who became her mother? Does PL: she have it in her heart to forgive her? And is it too late?  BY: Rod Freedman, Producer  PL: Abandoned in an Adelaide orphanage at the age of seven, Sophia feels PL: betrayed by her mother, Helen. In early adulthood, Sophia still feels angry PL: and resentful. Her mother is now married with two more children. Sophia PL: rejects her new family and refuses contact with her mother. In her PL: twenties, Sophia is now a filmmaker living in far away Sydney, embracing PL: her independence but deep down, blaming her mother when things go wrong in PL: her life. Yet Sophia finds herself drawn back to her mother's life, using PL: Helen's stories as inspiration for her films but disguising them as PL: fiction. Thirty years on, Helen has dementia. Sophia starts to question PL: their deeply troubled relationship. She digs out an unfinished documentary PL: film about Helen that she'd started as a film student years before and PL: finds herself compelled to finish it. Returning to her mother's former PL: homeland of Eastern Poland in what is now Ukraine, Sophia begins to trace PL: her mother's traumatic childhood. Orphaned as a young girl, Helen grows up PL: in a rural Polish village. As an adolescent, she's illiterate and homeless, PL: somehow surviving on the streets. As Sophia re-examines her mother's life, PL: she discovers the historical truth behind Helen's deportation to a Siberian PL: gulag. Helen was one of almost two million Poles who were incarcerated in PL: Russian gulags during World War Two. The truth behind this little known PL: episode of history reveals a dark story of betrayal involving Stalin and PL: the Allies.

Longing for a life outside of books, the PL: man is seen on a contemplative stroll when he comes upon 'Philosopher's PL: Walk', a historical, scenic footpath on university grounds.

Headed PL: to his study, the man is finally revealed to be a distinguished professor PL: of philosophy, thus raising an apparent contradiction. Can a philosopher PL: proclaim that it is best not to think at all?  BY: Conditioned Things

 MV: Plundering Tibet (2014)  PL: Plundering Tibet >>A personal take on mining in Tibet >> How much can an PL: ecosystem take before it collapses? >>> Plundering Tibet is a short PL: documentary about the dire consequences of China's ruthless mining in PL: Tibet. As a Canadian filmmaker, the narrator has a personal take on this PL: because of the involvement of Canadian companies in mining in Tibet-and the PL: railway to Lhasa. Following the arrival of the train in Tibet in 2006, PL: large-scale mining of lithium, gold, copper, lead, crude oil, natural gas PL: and other resources is under way to feed China's voracious industrial PL: sector. None of this benefits Tibetans. In fact, mining pollutes drinking PL: water, kills the livestock, and degrades the grasslands on which Tibetan PL: nomads depend. A disaster of Biblical proportions is unfolding in Tibet-so PL: big you can see it happening on Google Earth-the mines, the pollution, the PL: environmental damage. The environmental impact may go far beyond Tibet's PL: borders because of rivers that run downstream to ten Asian PL: nations--including India, Bangladesh, Thailand, Laos, Burma and Vietnam. PL: Tibet's abundant rivers supply large quantities of both water and power for PL: mining operations. Chinese engineers are heavily damming Tibet's mighty PL: rivers to supply power for large-scale mining operations: the building of PL: mega-dams will immediately affect the nations downstream. The documentary PL: uses undercover footage and still photography shot on location in PL: Tibet--including cellphone footage of an anti-mining protest smuggled out PL: of Tibet. Although some photography of mine sites was shot within Tibet, it PL: is extremely difficult to get to mining sites due to tight security in PL: remote locations. For mining sites in Tibet, the film uses Google Earth PL: flyovers to show what is happening on the ground, hidden from view.  BY: Michael Buckley

 MV: Razing the Bar: A Documentary About the Funhouse (2014)  PL: RAZING THE BAR documents the development and eventual demolition of a PL: well-loved fringe punk rock Seattle venue through interviews of employees, PL: friends, and a multitude of local musicians. By going out on a limb and PL: being uncompromising in his golden rule values, club owner Brian Foss PL: cultivates an environment that transforms an occasionally aggressive and PL: inhospitable music scene into a supportive and collaborative community PL: where many marginalized and outcast performers can finally call home. The PL: power of his influence is demonstrated in the entertaining juxtaposition of PL: the outrageous and often obscene acts inherent to punk performance against PL: the sincerity of love and respect shared amongst the key participants.  BY: Anonymous  PL: Loud, messy, and often outrageous, The Funhouse was one of Seattle's PL: landmark punk rock venues. From 2003 to 2012, the venue offered artists a PL: place to experiment with new musical styles and performance ideas, and PL: quickly became a breeding ground for local talent. As a young man, KEXP DJ PL: Brian Foss made the decision that it was better to fail at something that PL: you loved than spend a lifetime doing something that you hated, and he PL: imbued The Funhouse with the same spirit, creating a place where PL: creativity, risk, and fun could flourish both onstage and off. Many members PL: of the venue's offstage community soon found their way both onstage and PL: into the Seattle culture at-large, including the then-nascent burlesque PL: movement and the Rat City Rollergirls. First-time director Ryan Worsley was PL: one of those people in the crowd, and had been documenting the scene for PL: years. By incorporating a wealth of archival footage and memorabilia with PL: dozens of interviews with employees, friends, and a multitude of local PL: musicians, Worsley's Razing the Bar stands as a testament to the creative PL: community that The Funhouse fostered, as well as a warning of what may PL: become lost in Seattle's all-consuming quest for urban density.

 MV: The Characteristics of C-Minor (2014)  PL: Musician Knick Knox is likely to the sweetest guy you'll ever meet. But PL: when you see him on stage - trancelike behind the keyboard, shimmering with PL: dark mana, growling into the microphone - that sweet character you thought PL: you knew slips into a minor key. In The Characteristics of C-Minor, Nick PL: talks for the first time about his battles with his own mind. Lucid, PL: revealing interviews, and footage of glittering live performances, build a PL: portrait of a man who transforms his titanic internal struggles through his PL: art. To those who know Nick now, it comes as a surprise that he spent years PL: of his youth in painful isolation. Cut off from society and family, PL: strangled by a dangerous mix of physical and psychological impediments, PL: this isolation culminated in an incident that changed his life forever. PL: Nick still carries the scars and aftermath of that metamorphic event. PL: However, the years since the accident have seen him emerge into a truly PL: evolved man: glowing with warmth, intelligence, and love for his creative PL: community. What comes through strongly in The Characteristics of C-Minor is PL: Nick's ability to be radically vulnerable. This is the driving force for PL: his music. Solitary musical explorations have enabled a real sense of PL: self-discovery and emotional self-knowledge. This deep, new confidence, PL: combined with the widening validation of his community, lets us see a man PL: alive with gratitude and wonder as never before. Part biopic, part music PL: video, part tribute to gothic beauty, this affecting film pays witness to PL: the emotional armour of a scarred man, and to the thundering growl that PL: emerges when he peels it off.

PL: Sensing the young man might still make a stupid decision in his life, Ozzy PL: tells 'Will' the tale of two men he met while travelling in Greece who were PL: facing a similar dilemma. Like Will, these men, Hector and Jason, had both PL: lost the desire to live and like him they too planned to end their lives. PL: Ozzy explains that they found a way forward by not only facing their own PL: demons but by accidentally saving others in their quest to find answers. PL: Ozzy recounts their tale, transporting Will and the audience on a journey PL: to the islands of Greece where we see both men individually struggle with PL: their own loss and how their decision to travel impacts the lives of those PL: they meet on the journey. Despite being consumed by their own despair PL: Hector and Jason still show small acts of kindness to those whom they meet PL: which have stronger ramifications than they envisaged. Not only to those PL: strangers around them, but for themselves as well. Hector encounters Atia, PL: a mercenary recently returned from Libya who is carrying a heavy burden and PL: Jason meets Barbra, a British woman going through a difficult divorce. Each PL: character they encounter becomes a source for personal reconciliation as PL: they attempt to come to terms with their own grief and loss by PL: inadvertently helping others despite being haunted by ghosts from their PL: recent past. All the characters are linked by Ozzy, who meets them while he PL: travels from island to island looking for the next party and by a PL: mysterious dark woman dressed in white who constantly stalks the men. But PL: is everything as it seems or are their greater forces at work guiding them PL: on a journey that they have yet to fully comprehend?  BY: Lance Nielsen  
 MV: The Journey (2014/IV)  PL: The Journey is about a man who finds himself in the middle of nowhere after PL: his car breaks down. He finds a package with an address on it and feels PL: compelled to deliver it. He opens the box and finds a blank sheet of paper. PL: He starts writing his story and continues his journey. He meets a woman and PL: a man who give him directions. The film symbolizes our journey in life in PL: the sense that we walk through different phases to reach our destination. PL: The woman and the man represent the guidance of one's parents. The sheet of PL: paper is our story, some things we write ourselves and others are out of PL: our control.  BY: Anonymous  PL: Jason, an Englishman in his early forties arrives on a remote Greek island. PL: Having suffered the loss of someone close to him he wants to keep to PL: himself and stay away form everyone and everything. However from the moment PL: he arrives on the island, he meets locals and ex-pats who wish to befriend PL: him and in time begin to help him heal his wounds and look to his future. PL: And yet this country he has come to is not free of its own troubles and PL: wounds. Its people are suffering as well and Greece, like Jason, is once PL: again trying to find itself and its place in the world. 'The Journey' is a PL: film that portrays one man's quest to find himself again as he discovers PL: Greece for the first time in his life.

For Jason, our protagonist, Greece becomes the ideal environment PL: as it combines friendly, open-hearted people with a unique landscape which PL: he has not born witness to before. The island becomes a source of spiritual PL: healing for the character, its stunning beauty and the personal PL: reconciliation he experiences begins to enable him to take the first steps PL: on a road to finding his way forward at a time when he had given up all PL: hope. But is everything as it seems or are their greater forces at work PL: guiding him on his journey that he has yet to fully comprehend? But 'The PL: Journey' is not only a fictional film that tells the story of a man in a PL: country of unmatched beauty. It is not a story devoid of a real heart. PL: Taking place in the summer of 2011, at a time when the streets of London PL: are consumed with riots born out of frustration and hatred which mirror the PL: very recent past of Greece itself Jason is forced to re-evaluate his own PL: telescopic view of the country he finds himself in. As the protagonist PL: contemplates the events he witnesses on television unfolding in his own PL: country, his own interactions with the locals give him insight into the PL: Greek recession and its true consequences to the people's lives and a PL: unique perspective for him on one of the major flash points in recent Greek PL: history back in 2008.

 MV: The Universe (2014/III)  PL: This short provides a philosophical investigation on the experiences of PL: life, what it means to be - to interact with reality, and why reflection PL: and experiencing are mutually exclusive. Filmed in many different iconic PL: locations across the United States, namely Moab, Yosemite, Big Sur, PL: Colorado, and the Sierra Nevadas, the film explores different natural PL: experiences and couples them with reflections on human existence, the PL: validity of the experiences within reality, and the foundational role that PL: perception plays in understanding the world as well as engaging with the PL: world. The film also portrays and investigates inner conflicts with major PL: ideas concerning human existence such as mortality, care, anxiety, PL: temporality, and historicity. The film's investigation originates from the PL: Lockean self: the idea that a "being" is a self-aware and self-reflective PL: consciousness that is fixed in a body. Merleau-Ponty emphasized the body as PL: the primary site of knowing the world, a corrective to the long PL: philosophical tradition of placing consciousness as the source of PL: knowledge, and maintained that the body and that which it perceived could PL: not be disentangled from each other. Setting aside John Locke's PL: propositions on Ausgustinian original sin and the Cartesian position of PL: man's innate knowledge of logical propositions, the film further employs PL: Locke's posited tabula rasa, which is an "empty" mind that is shaped by PL: experience. Locke continues to surmise that sensation and reflection are PL: the two sources of all our ideas as humans. Edmund Husserl developed some PL: key conceptual elaborations which led him to assert that in order to study PL: the structure of consciousness, one would have to distinguish between the PL: act of consciousness and the phenomena at which it is directed. Thus PL: creating Phenomenology, or the study of the structure of an experience, PL: Husserl further developed an ancient Grecian idea, epoche, or "suspension" PL: that refers to a theoretical moment where all judgments about the existence PL: of the external world, and the actions therein, is suspended. The film PL: builds off of two ideas to explore major modern phenomenologist claims: the PL: true nature of being is withdrawal, and that experience and reflection are PL: the source of human existence.

Tere (11) rehearses a play PL: with a group of amateurs: she is going to be Puck in "A Midsummer Night's PL: Dream" We always see her silent- either watching others or lost in her PL: thoughts- but we can hear her voice as an adult narrating her story. Her PL: rival is whimsical Andrea (12), in love with the same boy, handsome Rafa PL: (12). Ana Bel�n (13) helps Andrea to make a love potion, although she is PL: not sure to retain her "powers" since she started menstruating. Alex (13), PL: fond of the macabre and comfortable in his bad-boy role, refuses to admit PL: he likes Andrea. Rounding out the group of friends is clumsy R2 (12), PL: Alex's faithful companion, Paul (9), Rafa's younger brother, and Tim, a dog PL: that looks like something out of the Famous Five adventures. But there is PL: someone else: in the village you can still see posters with the photo of PL: Dani (8), who disappeared mysteriously. The last time his friends saw him, PL: they left him all alone in a forbidden place, where he was the victim of a PL: cruel joke: if he tried to escape, a mysterious character would snatch him PL: up forever ... Andrea and Ana Bel�n leave Tere aside when they arrange the PL: spell which should trap Rafa's will: an item of the beloved's clothing, a PL: concoction prepared by a virgin, a magical object obtained after passing a PL: test of courage ... a task that seems doomed to fail. Memories of adult PL: Tere mix up the characters' fate with the theatrical representation in PL: which couples break up and get together as if by magic, leading to an end PL: in which secrets are revealed among unexpected occurrences.

Her and her PL: husband left to travel the world and were never seen or heard from again. PL: When Paramount expanded, the original Bronson Gate was preserved and is now PL: the oldest remaining structure at Paramount. There is a legend that if you PL: have what it takes to make it in the Industry, touching the Old Bronson PL: gate can give that piece of luck you need to start you on your way. Vivian PL: South has been given the same "Lucky" distinction. Like the Bronson Gate, PL: no one has ever been able to tell who Vivian will touch next, and send on PL: their way to Stardom.

The Alchemical Androgyne (The Hermafrodite / Rebis), PL: ever present character in my videos, embodies my search in the PL: androgenization rites, in this case a rite performed by indigenous tribes PL: where a man makes a cut in his crotch as a symbol to inhabit in a woman PL: body, to live in the middle of two imposed sexes. A symbolic castration PL: that I present as an invitation to "man" to reflect about his feminity. The PL: other character is basically my way of using the right of rebellion through PL: art, to criticize religi�n which seek to control the souls, current clinic PL: aims to control the body (based not on health but disease) and The Armed PL: Forces as the top of a pyramid that ends up collapsed.

Further PL: investigation soon revealed many unanswered questions and loose ends...the PL: death of an ex-godfather status accountant of Hong Kong, the threats to PL: even the seemingly harmless witnesses and informers, and the surfacing of a PL: mysterious lady that has all connection with LOK's wanted list but with a PL: background as simple and as tragic as a girl next door with terminal PL: illness...

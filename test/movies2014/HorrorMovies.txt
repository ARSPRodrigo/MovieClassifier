 MV: Razing the Bar: A Documentary About the Funhouse (2014)  PL: RAZING THE BAR documents the development and eventual demolition of a PL: well-loved fringe punk rock Seattle venue through interviews of employees, PL: friends, and a multitude of local musicians. By going out on a limb and PL: being uncompromising in his golden rule values, club owner Brian Foss PL: cultivates an environment that transforms an occasionally aggressive and PL: inhospitable music scene into a supportive and collaborative community PL: where many marginalized and outcast performers can finally call home. The PL: power of his influence is demonstrated in the entertaining juxtaposition of PL: the outrageous and often obscene acts inherent to punk performance against PL: the sincerity of love and respect shared amongst the key participants.  BY: Anonymous  PL: Loud, messy, and often outrageous, The Funhouse was one of Seattle's PL: landmark punk rock venues. From 2003 to 2012, the venue offered artists a PL: place to experiment with new musical styles and performance ideas, and PL: quickly became a breeding ground for local talent. As a young man, KEXP DJ PL: Brian Foss made the decision that it was better to fail at something that PL: you loved than spend a lifetime doing something that you hated, and he PL: imbued The Funhouse with the same spirit, creating a place where PL: creativity, risk, and fun could flourish both onstage and off. Many members PL: of the venue's offstage community soon found their way both onstage and PL: into the Seattle culture at-large, including the then-nascent burlesque PL: movement and the Rat City Rollergirls. First-time director Ryan Worsley was PL: one of those people in the crowd, and had been documenting the scene for PL: years. By incorporating a wealth of archival footage and memorabilia with PL: dozens of interviews with employees, friends, and a multitude of local PL: musicians, Worsley's Razing the Bar stands as a testament to the creative PL: community that The Funhouse fostered, as well as a warning of what may PL: become lost in Seattle's all-consuming quest for urban density.

 MV: Unlikely Heroes of the Arab Spring (2014)  PL: Presented by the award-winning author and property-rights activist Hernando PL: de Soto, this public television special presents, for the first time, the PL: basic human and economic events that led to the Arab uprisings in the PL: Middle East and North Africa. The program shows that "The Arab Spring" was PL: less a political event than it was about the coming of the industrial PL: revolution to a region where over 90% of the population lives and works PL: outside the rule of law. De Soto shows us that this informal economy is, PL: however, the one common thread that can contribute to the region's growth PL: and stability. Amid provocative images of the Arab uprisings of 2010 and PL: 2011, De Soto introduces the people and events that recently rocked the PL: Arab world, sparked by the self-immolation of the poor, 26 year old street PL: vendor, Tarek Bouazizi. It was not the $225 lost from his fruit cart, PL: expropriated by the police, that transformed young Bouazizi into a martyr PL: and a symbol of the revolution - it was his similarity to the 180 million PL: informal Arab entrepreneurs; many of them under 30 and computer literate. PL: Over 100 of them followed Bouazizi in acts of self-immolation. The history PL: of business in the Arab world is highlighted in sequences from Morocco, and PL: the program demonstrates how business is thriving along with Arab culture PL: in the international business city of Istanbul. Traveling through the PL: region, De Soto summarizes, "Throughout the Middle East the story is the PL: same. As the industrial revolution comes to the Middle East, the true path PL: to stability rests in the region's single common denominator: the informal PL: marketplace. The Arab consensus ahead is about more than emancipating the PL: entrepreneurial spirit; it's about resolving the institutional deficiencies PL: that make most Arabs desperately poor."

 MV: Usher's Legacy (2014)  PL: With sex, violence, terror, suspicion, intrigue and secrets added to the PL: mix, this interpretation of Poe's classic tale, The Fall of the House of PL: Usher, promises to remain faithful to the original story, more faithful PL: than recent adaptations, and not seen since the superb AIP, Roger Corman PL: version from 1960 starring Vincent Price and Myrna Fahey. It adheres to PL: essential story lines with minor alterations as opposed to major plot line PL: overhauls, like so many adaptations, keeping the original story intact but PL: by adding to the story rather than changing it.

Sitting PL: on this emotional, mental powder keg is not bad enough, for further PL: conflict arises when two outsiders come into their dark domain, hustlers PL: from Matthew's past outside of the house. Just like in the original story PL: Roderick proves his love and lengths that he is willing to go to protect PL: his brother. Mystery, madness and a lot of blood is let, to keep Matthew PL: safe at all costs. Roderick and Matthew's childhood friend Kieth soon PL: arrives after, to help care for the failing brothers but soon finds himself PL: powerless to offer any comfort or aid to his sick and dying friends. PL: Further complicating the matter is the arrival of the second outsider, PL: looking for the first. Very soon some family secrets are revealed, and PL: further questions arise, while terror visits and the Usher madness is PL: raised to further levels of evil. Roderick's madness deepens to the PL: breaking point and Kieth is witness to the full horror of what the Usher PL: Legacy really is as truths are finally revealed, as the dead rise from the PL: grave, and the madness in the House of Usher goes insane and totally out of PL: control.
